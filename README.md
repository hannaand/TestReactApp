# TestReactApp
This is a test App with React. My idea is to test various functions and present it in a very simple single page app.
## Installation
Clone the repo and open it in your browser. 
## Usage
Use webpack watch mode not to manually upgrade page.
webpack --progress --colors --watch
## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
